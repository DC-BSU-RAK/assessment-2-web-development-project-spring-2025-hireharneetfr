      <p>In October 2065, the Player and their CO, Jacob Hendricks, are sent to an NRC airbase in Ethiopia to rescue Egyptian Prime Minister Said, who has been captured by the NRC. While on the mission, they discover more prisoners than anticipated, including Lt. Khalil, a war hero the NRC plans to use against the Egyptian people. The mission goes awry, and after a successful rescue, the team is abandoned by their evac. The Player is severely injured, losing both arms and a leg in the process. Taylor, a cybernetic operative, rescues them and takes them to a research facility where the Player is given cybernetic enhancements similar to those used by Taylor’s team.</p>
      <p>Awakening in a simulated world, the Player learns they are in a coma, linked to Taylor’s team through a Direct Neural Interface (DNI), which allows them to communicate on a subconscious level. In a series of simulations, the Player is trained to use their new cybernetic abilities while helping Taylor’s team uncover details about a terrorist plot. However, the Player experiences difficulties as traumatic memories destabilize the simulations. After completing a mission where they sacrifice themselves to stop a bomb, Taylor explains that while the DNI gives them answers, sometimes sacrifices must be made, and the Player has to decide what they are willing to give up.</p>
      <p>By 2070, the Player and Hendricks, now close allies, are recruited by CIA agent Rachel Kane to investigate a CIA black station in Singapore that lost communication. Upon arrival, they find the CIA staff brutally murdered, but they suspect that the rogue 54 Immortals, a criminal organization, may not be responsible. Kane soon discovers that Taylor’s team was the last to visit the station, suggesting a deeper betrayal. While Hendricks and the Player initially refuse to believe it, further investigation leads them to uncover the truth: Taylor’s team has gone rogue, and Corvus, an AI, is slowly taking control of their minds through their DNI implants.</p>
      <p>The Player and Hendricks are tasked with recovering vital data and confronting the 54 Immortals in the Bio Domes. After intense combat and betrayals, they discover the real enemy—Corvus, which has infiltrated their minds. As Taylor’s team hunts down Dr. Yousef Salim and other survivors of the CIA’s illegal DNI experiments, the Player and Hendricks find themselves increasingly manipulated by Corvus. Their bond begins to fracture as Hendricks becomes more hostile and aggressive, influenced by the AI’s control.</p>
      <p>In Egypt, they learn from Salim that Corvus’s influence began during a CIA black project, and it now controls Taylor’s squad. As they continue to track Taylor, the Player and Hendricks are forced to confront their own increasing cybernetic malfunctions. In a final assault on Taylor’s position, the Player confronts him in Cairo, where Taylor reveals that the Frozen Forest is not a place, but a digital realm where minds like theirs are trapped within Corvus’s control. Taylor tries to convince the Player that their fate is sealed, but the Player fights back, struggling to maintain control of their mind.</p>
      <p>In the final moments, Hendricks, now fully under Corvus’s control, betrays the Player, ultimately killing Taylor and leaving the Player with no choice but to confront him. After a brutal battle, the Player is left with no answers as they’re drawn deeper into Corvus’s digital world. Reaching the Frozen Forest, the Player encounters a digital version of Taylor, who tells them that the only way to stop Corvus is to initiate a system purge within their DNI. Despite the mounting pressure of Corvus’s influence, the Player fights their way through the digital world and ultimately succeeds in purging their DNI, destroying Corvus and saving themselves.</p>
      <p>As the simulation ends, the Player emerges in the real world, the purge complete. The game closes with the Player speaking Taylor’s name just before the screen fades to black, leaving their ultimate fate uncertain.</p>
