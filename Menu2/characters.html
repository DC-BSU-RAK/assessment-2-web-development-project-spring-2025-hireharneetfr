        <div class="char-box" data-name="Ruin" data-info="Born into a military family and raised in a tough neighborhood, Donnie Walsh grew up fearless and headstrong.
        Joining the army straight out of high school, Walsh is an infantry soldier through and through; the battlefield has become his second home.
        He is suspicious of covert ops and anything that operates outside of the established chain of command, viewing them as dishonorable. He prefers a straight-up fair fight, and knows that there's never a substitute for good boots on the ground.
        Now cybernetically augmented, he uses his unique abilities to rush headlong into the fray, meeting his enemies with sheer unadulterated and overwhelming force! (Fandom, 2004)">

        <div class="char-box" data-name="Outrider" data-info="As an orphan on the streets of Rio De Janeiro's Rocinha favela, Alessandra 'Les' Castillo survived on her sharp eye and keen wits.
        Given an education in one of the city's international missions, she spent her spare time traversing rooftop to rooftop, watching the people moving in the streets below, noticing patterns and learning how to predict their movements.
        After joining the Brazilian Army at 18, her agility and observational skills quickly earned her a place in the Bda Op Esp, the Special Forces.
        Now an advance scout, she stalks the battlefield, tracking down her prey before destroying it with lethal accuracy. (Fandom, 2004)">

        <div class="char-box" data-name="Prophet" data-info="Wilkes got his first set of cybernetic augmentations while serving in the British Engineering Corps. Five years and 
        many upgrades later, he is the embodiment of the cutting edge of human weaponry on the battlefield, using his superior technology to disrupt opponents’ tactics before moving in for the kill. (Fandom, 2004)">

        <div class="char-box" data-name="Battery" data-info="The only daughter and youngest child of five siblings, Erin Baker always had to fight to get her way. Following in a family
         tradition of over 100 years of military service, and watching her brothers enter the US Army one-by-one, she finally graduated high school and enrolled herself. Driven to excel 
         by her ongoing rivalry with her brothers, she volunteered for Airborne School, before crushing the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program. Heavily armored, she fearlessly operates
          ahead of the front lines, nimbly traversing urban environments, as she destroys HVTs with salvoes of advanced high-explosive munitions. (Fandom, 2004)">

        <div class="char-box" data-name="Seraph" data-info="The only child of a feared officer of the 54 Immortals, He Zhen-Zhen was raised within ranks of the Singapore Quarantine Zone's ruling criminal combine.
        She proved to be an excellent and dedicated pupil, learning the traditions and honored lineage of the organization while pursuing martial training with a singled-minded determination. She worked hard not to disappoint her father or the combine's leadership.
        At 17, she was elevated to the rank of Enforcer, one of the few who police the combine from within while ruthlessly executing the will of the 54I wherever and whenever it might be required. (Fandom, 2004)">

        An ex-member of the Elite Colombian Rapid Deployment Force, FUDRA, he is an expert in jungle warfare, able to blend into the forests and survive off of the land almost indefinitely.
        After discovering too late that the targets of their last S&D mission were their own, his unit was broken up, its members reassigned to other teams; soon, under suspicious circumstances, his ex-squad mates started turning up dead.
        As sole survivor, he seeks retribution for his fallen friends, using his skills to turn the environment against his enemies. (Fandom, 2004)">

        After several politically embarrassing mishaps and budget overruns, the project was cancelled and most of the prototypes were stripped for parts.
        Fate had other plans for EWR-115, when years later it was discovered to have been stolen.
        Reports of sightings of the terrible machine on battlefields around the world began to surface. No one knows why it fights or who, if anyone, is issuing its orders. (Fandom, 2004)">

        <div class="char-box" data-name="Spectre" data-info="Next to nothing is known about the presumed wet-works Specialist, Spectre. The designation itself is a codename agreed 
        upon by the various agencies that have pooled their intelligence on unsolved assassinations, inferring his or her existence based on either evidence found at the scene or 
        from fragmentary reports given by shaken bystanders. Despite heavy redaction, all accounts suggest an individual capable of extraordinary stealth, able to evade or neutralize 
        the most sophisticated of manned or automated security set-ups. In every case, Spectre’s victims have been ‘handled’ with surgically precise mid-line wounds with rarely any signs of struggle.(Fandom, 2004)">

        <div class="char-box" data-name="Firebreak" data-info="Prague-born Krystof Hejek is a battlefield problem solver; armed with a powerful arsenal of weaponry, he effectively 
        resolves numerous issues over and over again using his favorite tool, fire. Whether it's direct one-on-one confrontation or the strategic denial of areas, there's no questioning 
        Hejek's utility, even if the results of his work can be hard to stomach. Working up-close-and-personal with flame is something that very few volunteer to do, but Hejek thrives on it; 
        he and fire appear to have come to an understanding. Usually calm and dispassionate, the only time he truly lights up is when his enemies do.(Fandom, 2004)">

        Deeming that they had suffered too many losses already, the enforcer, Seraph decided not to execute him for his part in the deaths of Min and Xuilan Goh, stating that they needed all of their remaining strength in order to rebuild.
        Blackjack now operates as a mercenary, restoring his reputation, and bringing glory to the clan; all the while salvaging up new stock from the spoils on the battlefield. (Fandom, 2004)">
